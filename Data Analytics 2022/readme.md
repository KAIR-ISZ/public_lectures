# Data Analytics

Course for Automatic Control and Robotics, specialties:

- Cyber-physical Systems,
- Informatyka w Sterowaniu i ZarzÄ…dzaniu

## Project specification

1. Form 2 person teams
1. Select a phenomena to model and find data for it.
2. Propose two models to represent the phenomena.
3. Perform prior analysis and selection.
4. Fit the models and analyze posterior predictive distributions - are they capturing the data. Repeat steps 3-5 if necessary.
5. Perform comparison of models with WAIC and LOO information criteria.
6. Report your findings (written report for grading, can be generated from jupyter + presentation for last classes).

Projects will be graded with a checklist. Each team will grade two randomly assigned teams. 
Final grade will be a weighted average of results (25%-25%-50% Team1-Team2-Teachers).


## Laboratory class requirements

It is recommended to use your own laptop computers.

Class work is realized in Python 3, in order to be able to work smoothly it is required (or at least strongly recommended) to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and to ensure that you have up to date versions of following packages:

- [CmdStanPy](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - installation requires bit of work or [CmdStanPy](https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io)
- [Arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [SciPy](scipy)

During the course we will be using GitHub, where you will be submiting the results of excercises.

Recommended editor is VSCode with Stan extension.
